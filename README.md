Che-Chuan(Suibi) Weng 翁哲川

 My name is Che Chuan "Suibi" Weng, and I am an accomplished interactive media engineer and digital artist. My primary focus is on developing interactive installations, with a particular specialization in the AR/VR and Arduino components. I have had the privilege of teaching technical courses such as Unity Development and Arduino Basic at three esteemed universities.
As a digital artist, my works have been selected for inclusion in several highly regarded festivals, including the Digital Arts Festival in Taipei and the 404 International Festival of Art and Technology in Argentina.
Currently, I am enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado Boulder, which I commenced in 2021. My research interest is centered on the human perception in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, and I am enthusiastic about advancing this area of study.
